Automation plays a very important role in the global economy and in everyday life. Automatic systems are 
preferred over handmade programs of any kind. We can also call it the "SMART STREET LIGHT 
SYSTEM". The smart light sensor refers to public street light, which is familiar with the movement of 
pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists. street lights, also called adaptive streetlights, dim when no work is 
available but light up when movement is detected. Research shows an automatic control of traffic lights, 
which may save some energy. In terms of industrial development, automation goes a step further than 
machinery. Functional muscle needs, automation greatly reduces the need for human mental and sensory 
needs. Basically, street lighting is one of the most important parts. The number of roads is increasing rapidly 
due to the congestion of many vehicles. Keywords: Light Dependent Resistors (LDR), Light Emitting Diode 
(LED), Infrared Sensor (IR), Internet Of Things (IOT).
